## General Information
- The dataset has information on loan accepted and the status of repayment of the loan - Default and Non-Default
- The dataset has various customer attributes and loan attributes for analysis
- The objective is to identify factors which affect loan repayment. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.
